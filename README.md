# Anniversary Photo Stream _for Amy and Eamon_ 
<sup> This is a cloned Repo originally for a <a href="https://github.com/colbyfayock/demo-photo-library-starter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photo Stream App using Cloudinary</a> as the photo storage repository. It was created for a FreeCodeCamp tutorial by Colby Faycock</sup><br/>  

This is a digital photo album (aka photo stream) web application that I created for my girlfriend and I. Instead of using Cloudinary, I am storing photos in an S3 bucket (currently with AWS, but in the future Cloudflare).<br/>  
I have incorporated Google Maps API for react using <a href="https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/"> Visgl React Google Maps </a> and a tool called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/exifr"> Exifr </a> which can extract metadata from images, such as gps coordinates and timestamps. These are the two main tools I use in this project in order to display data on the embedded Google Map, using Google Maps API _markers_ and _info window_.<br/>
